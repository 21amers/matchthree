Basic match-three clone

My attempt at cloning the biggest money maker in casual gaming. Results may vary.   I'll do some blogging thing about this on my website at some point soon. 

The roadmap:

* Grid scaling based on screen size.
* Capping window scale to specific aspect ratios
* Game code separate from general game loop
* Level loading code
* click and move interaction
* Detecting a match solution
* Detecting combos
* Generating new object for the completed matches
* Game state of some sort for level loading, switching and menus
* Need to create font/text support
* Only supports mouse for movement
* funky issues with various resolutions and screensizes..will fix as I get there
* Textures need to be moved to a spritesheet ( this will come later)
* Animation support with sprite sheets and transformations. 
* Sound
